fine-grained-matching-protocol
==============================
The plan in the project is to tackle the challenge of implementing a protocol, never

implemented before, after modifying it whenever required. The protocol is about fine-grained 

private matching for proximity-based social networking. It works on wireless networks, and 

there was no technique for private matching before this protocol which would not let any pair 

of node in the wireless network do matching without transmitting information stored on each 

node.
